I've been down and I'm wondering why
These little black clouds keep walking around
With me
With me

It wastes time and I'd rather be high
Think I'll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile
But be free
They're all free

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

I look around at a beautiful life
I've been the upper side of down
Been the inside of out
But we breathe
We breathe

I wanna breeze and an open mind
I wanna swim in the ocean
Wanna take my time for me
All me

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
