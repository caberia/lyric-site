I spend my nights down on the wharf
In unlit alleyways
By the church downtown
Where Sally prays

Come down sometime
We'll share a rusty can of corn, yeah
And listen to the radio
"I love you, I love you", it says

Where did your heart go?
Did you put it on a train?
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico?

Where did your heart go?
Did you put it on a train?
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico?

You cried but I don't know how
I've heard it all before
There it goes again
The slamming of the door

Sometimes the river calls me
And at night it calls my name
Says, ''Put your troubles down beside me''
Things have always been the same
