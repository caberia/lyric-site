Life it seems to fade away
Drifting further everyday
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
I need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss this can't be real
I cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn, yeah
I was me but now, he's gone

Hey, do you hear us Cliff? Do you hear us Cliff?

No one but me can save myself, but its too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try, oh no

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Oh, but death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
So goodbye
Yeah goodbye
I say goodbye
