Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still

Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing
            </pre>
