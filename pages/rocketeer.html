Here we go
Come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand
Close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go
Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Where we stop? Nobody knows (knows)

Where we go, we don't need roads (roads)
And where we stop? Nobody knows (knows)
To the stars if you really want it
Got, got a jetpack with your name on it

Above the clouds and the atmosphere (sphere)
Just say the words and we outta here (outta here)
Hold my hand if you feelin' scared (scared)
We're flyin' up, up outta here

Here we go
Come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand
Close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go
Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go (here we go)
Where we stop? Nobody knows, knows (here we go)

Baby, we can stay fly like a G6
Shop the streets of Tokyo, get you fly kicks
Girl, you're always on my mind
Got my head up in the sky
And I'm never lookin' down, feelin' priceless, yeah

Where we at, only few have known
Want some next level? Super Mario
I hope this works out, cardio
'Til then let's fly
Geronimo

Here we go
Come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand
Close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly

Nah, I ain't ever been to space before
But I ain't never seen a face like yours
You make me feel like I can touch the planets
You want the moon, girl? Watch me grab it
See, I ain't ever seen a star this close
You got me stuck by the way you glow
I'm like oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm like oh, oh, oh, oh

Here we go (yeah)
Come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand
Close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go
Let's fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Where we stop? Nobody knows, knows
